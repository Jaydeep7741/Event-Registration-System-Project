## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The Event Registration System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of registering users for events and managing event-related data. It aims to simplify manual registration processes, reduce errors, and provide an efficient platform for both attendees and event organizers.

### 1.2 Scope
The system allows users to register, log in, browse events, and book seats, while administrators can create, update, and manage events and registrations. It is developed using Java (JSP/Servlets) for the backend and frontend, with MySQL for data storage, ensuring scalability and ease of use.

### 1.3 Motivation
Manual event registration processes are time-consuming and prone to errors. This system automates registration, enhances user experience, and provides administrators with tools to manage events effectively, making it suitable for academic, professional, and community events at Dr. D Y Patil Technical Campus, Varale.
